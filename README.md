<h1>Fuata - A Custom Version Control System</h1>

<p>
  Fuata is a simple, custom version control system inspired by Git. The primary goal of Fuata is to manage changes
  to files and directories by creating and maintaining a history of changes, including stages for added files, committed
  changes and viewing the history through logs. The tool is command-line based, similar to how Git is used, and
  provides basic version control functionalities such as adding files, committing changes and viewing
  logs.

## Overview
<p>
  Fuata operates on a simple set of commands to initialise a repository within an existing directory, add files to the staging area,
  create commits from staged files, and view commit history.
  Each file is tracked with a hash, representing its content. Changes are tracked at the file level, and directories
  are represented as trees, where the tree's nodes point to file hashes or other subdirectories (subtrees).
</p>

### Tools Used
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fuata has been written in <code>Kotlin</code></li>
    <li><code>IntelliJ IDE</code> for development</li>
    <li><code>Git</code> for version control...ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜† (c'mon, cut me some slack)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

## Command-Line Usage
Fuata uses several commands similar to Git, including:
- ```bash
  # Initialise a repository
  $ fuata init

  # Stage a file
  $ fuata add <file_name>

  # Commit staged files
  $ fuata commit "Include a commit message"

  # View commit history
  $ fuata log
  ```

## Internal Architecture
<p>
  Fuata takes advantage of two main concepts:
  <ul>
    <li><code>Hashing</code> for Content-Addressable Storage (CAS file system)</li>
    <li>A <code>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</code> data structure to represent the entire version contol system</li>
  </ul>
</p>

### High Level Diagram of the System
<div>
  <img src="res/System_Overview.png" alt="System Architecture" />
  <p>
    In the diagram above, you can see a visual representation of the DAG with its different types of nodes: Blob, Tree and Commit objects.
    The commits are the top references. They point to other commits as well as the root tree created during the creation of a commit. The tree represents
    a directory or subdirectories and they can point to blobs. A blob represents a file. The most recent commit is pointed to by the HEAD; a symbolic link
    to a file in refs folder, that holds the actual hash of the commit.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <img src="res/DAG_Objects.png" alt="DAG objects" height="500" />
  <p>
    The diagram above shows the data that each of the three DAG node types holds.
  </p>
</div>


### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Objects
<div>
  Fuata operates using an object-based model where each node in the DAG can either be a <code>Blob</code>, <code>Tree</code> or
  <code>Commit</code> object.
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <code>Blob</code>
      <p>
        Each file in Fuata is tracked by its content hash. This hash serves as a unique identifier for the file's content. When a file is created, its content is taken
        and used to create a hash using the SHA-1 algorithm. A new file, with the hash as its filename, is created in the <code>objects</code> folder of the repository
        proper. The content of the file in working directory is then taken, serialised, and compressed into a <code>ByteArray</code>. This byte array forms the <code>Blob</code>;. This blob
          is then taken and written in the object file <code>.fuata/objects/&lt;file_hash&gt;</code>. When a file changes, a new hash is generated and the file is re-staged. Even a single character
        change will result in a new hash from the SHA-1 algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>Internal structure of a <code>Blob</code>:</p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-kotlin">
          @Serializable
          data class Blob(
              val type: String = "blob",
              val path: String,
              val fileContent: String
          )
        </code>
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>Tree</code>
      <p>
        A directory is represented as a tree in Fuata. Each tree object contains references to other trees (subdirectories) or files
        (by their hashes). These tree objects form a hierarchical structure that mirrors the file system's directory structure.
        Additionally, a tree object (a root tree) is created when creating a new commit, and references all directories and files
        present in the working directory at that specific time.
      </p>
      <p>Internal structure of a <code>Tree</code>:</p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-kotlin">
          @Serializable
          data class Tree(
              val type: String = "tree",
              val entries: Map&lt;String, String&gt; = mapOf()
          )
        </code>
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>Commits</code>
      <p>
        A commit contains the current state of the repository, including references to the root tree and metadata like the commit message and 
        timestamp. Each commit is associated with a unique hash. A new commit will reference the root tree created during a commit operation and also the parent commit (the
        immediate former commit being pointed to by <code>HEAD</code>
      </p>
      <p>Internal structure of a <code>Commit</code>:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          @Serializable
          data class Commit(
              val type: String = "commit",
              val tree: String,
              val parent: String?,
              val author: String = "John Doe <john.doe@gmail.com>",
              val timestamp: String,
              val message: String
          )
        </code>
      </pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

### Hashing and Compression
<p>
  Fuata uses the <code>SHA-1</code> hashing algorithm that takes a String type and returns a 40-digit hexadecimal value as a String.
  For compression, Kotlin's internal libraries are used. Specifically, the <code>Deflater</code> and <code>Inflater</code> classes and their methods
  are used to decompress and compress items, respectively. The output of this compression is a ByteArray, while decompression reverts it to its original
  string. This compressed data is what is written in files within the objects folder (object files). This is crucial in minimising the space taken by these object
  files, making Fuata more efficient.
</p>

### Staging
<p>
  When staging a file that exists in the working directory, Fuata takes the file and creates a Blob which is stored in the objects folder with the hash of the file
  content as the object file filename. The details of the file are also added to an index file within the repository proper. The index file stores information as a JSON
  string where it is a JSON array of JSON objects. Each object includes the <code>path</code> (actual file path in the working directory) and the <code>hash</code>
  generated from the file content.
  The content within the index file will look like this:
  <pre>
    <code>
      [
        {
          path: "src/kotlin/main.kt",
          hash: "abc123...7x8y9z"
        },
        {
          path: "src/kotlin/models/Blob.kt",
          hash: "uio567...1j2k3l"
        }
      ]
    </code>
  </pre>
</p>

### Tree Construction
<p>
  A tree object is created to represent a directory. This tree has a list of entries that point to blobs of files existing within that directory.
  Subsequently, a tree object is also created during the committing process. A root tree that points to all subtrees or blobs present at a particular
  moment, representing the state of the working directory.
</p>

## How It Works

### Initialising a Fuata Repository
The command `fuata init` is used for this purpose.

In your pwd (present working directory), this command will create a new dot-prefixed directory called `.fuata`.
Additionally, the following directories and files will be created within the `.fuata` directory:
- HEAD (file)
- refs/heads/main (dir)
- objects (dir)
- index (file)

The HEAD file is a symbolic reference to the most recent commit and the current branch the repository is in. It achieves
this by pointing to `refs/heads/<current_branch>`.

The `objects` directory holds all the blobs, tree objects and commit objects that have been created during the staging of
files and commits.

The `index` file holds a list of dictionaries representing metadata of the files that have been staged. All files contained
in this file are then used to create a commit.

The `refs` directory holds information on all the branches that exist in the directory. During initialisation, the first
branch created is the `main` branch under `refs/heads/main`. Inside this main file, is a commit hash of the most
recent commit. If no commit has been made, this file will be empty.

After initialisation, the repository proper will have the structure below:
```xml
.fuata
    |__objects
    |__refs
    |    |__heads
    |        |__main
    |__HEAD
    |__index
```

### Staging a File
The command `fuata add <filename>` is used for this purpose.

For this to work correctly, you have to be in the root directory that contains the .fuata repository.

When staging a file, for example `test.txt`, it is added to `.fuata/index` as a JSON object.

```json
{
   "path": "path/to/file",
   "hash": "abc123...7x8y9z"
}
```
Additionally, a hash is generated from the content of test.txt and a blob is created for it and placed in `.fuata/objects`.
The hash is used as the file name for the blob. The content of this blob is a compressed `ByteArray` generated
from the metadata of test.txt. This metadata includes the file path and the file content.

### Committing a File
The command `fuata commit "<commit_message>"` is used for this purpose.

Firstly, the `.fuata/index` file is read to identify all the staged files. Afterwards, the parent commit (currently pointed
to by HEAD) and its parent tree are retrieved. A new root tree is created for this new commit and the files in the 
staging area are added to its references. If any files referenced by the parent tree have not changed, they are also added
to the new root tree being created. The staging area is then cleared. After this new root tree is created, its converted
into a JSON object that is used to generate a hash, then converted into a compressed ByteArray and stored in an object
in `.fuata/objects`.

A new commit is also created, referencing this root tree. The commit is also made to point to the previous commit.
An object file with the commit metadata is also created and stored in `.fuata/objects`.

### Logging Commit History
The command `fuata log` command is used for this purpose.

Firstly, the current branch `HEAD` is pointing to in the `refs` directory, is read to obtain the hash of the most recent commit (head commit).
Since this hash is the file name of a commit object file in `.fuata/objects`, the details of the commit are extracted. Each commit
points to the previous commit and, therefore, the commits can be traversed to display their deserialised metadata.

### Creating Branches
The command `fuata create-branch <branch_name>` is used for this purpose.

This command creates a new file in the `refs/heads` directory and copies the hash of the head commit.
For example, if a new branch named `new_branch` is created, the new file will be `refs/heads/new_branch`.

The content of the `HEAD` file will also be overwritten to point to the newly created branch.
